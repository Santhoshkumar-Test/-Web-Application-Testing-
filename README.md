# 📌 Project-2: Manual Testing of SauceDemo E-Commerce Workflow
Welcome to my **Intermediate Manual Testing Project 🚀**.<br>
In this project, I performed **end-to-end manual testing** on the **SauceDemo E-commerce Web Application**.
The objective of this project is to simulate a **real QA testing process using the STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)**.<br>
From **Day-1 to Day-6**, I created all testing deliverables step-by-step, just like a real QA team working on a sprint.

The workflow tested in this project:
**Login → Product Listing → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Completion**

# 🔍 Tester Observations

Beyond standard pass/fail results, the following behavioral issues were observed during exploratory testing:

**OBS-01 — No Field-Level Input Validation**
> Both the Login page and Checkout – Your Information page only show a generic banner-style error on invalid/empty input. There is no inline per-field validation to guide the user about which specific field has an issue.

**OBS-02 — Broken Page for Invalid Product URL**
> Navigating to `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory-item.html?id=77` (or any ID beyond 0–5) shows a broken "Item Not Found" page with a dog image and random text — indicating missing URL parameter validation.

**OBS-03 — Empty Cart Checkout Allowed**
> The system allows users to complete the full checkout flow and place an order even when the cart is completely empty — a business logic defect that should be restricted.
